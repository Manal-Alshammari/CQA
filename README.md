# Curriculum Quality Assurance(CQA) Model




> CQA is a model helps to measure the alignment status between an academic program 
> student outcomes(SO) and courses learning outcomes (CLO).

After giving the two files (SO file & CLO file), CQA will calculate the similarity
and alignment between them.
That percentage indicate how much the course is aligned with the academic program 
goals and aim. And the final decision is subjective, which means the curriculum 
development community will decide whether the course is suitable and serves program 
goals, or it should be replaced with another course more aligned to the program.
